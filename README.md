## Acknowledgments

NA-MIC was founded as a multi-institutional, interdisciplinary team of computer scientists, software engineers, and medical investigators to develop computational tools for the analysis and visualization of medical image data. It was funded from 2004-2015 using a grant, U54 EB005149, from the NIBIB NIH HHS. NA-MIC created infrastructure and environment for the development of computational algorithms and open-source technologies, and created training and dissemination mechanisms for these tools to be distributed to the medical research community.
